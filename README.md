## Brainfuck Interpreter in Go

This project is a simple **BrainForge** written in Go. It reads a Brainfuck program from a file and executes it. The interpreter simulates the Brainfuck language's memory and pointer manipulation to output the result of the program.

## Requirements

- Go 1.18 or higher

## Usage

To use the Brainfuck interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the code.

2. Create a Brainfuck program file (e.g., `hello_world.bf`).

3. Run the interpreter with the following command:

   ```bash
   go run compiler.go <filename>
